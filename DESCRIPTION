Description: Fit growth models to otoliths and/or tagging data, using RTMB and
  maximum likelihood. The otoliths (or similar measurements of age) provide
  direct observed coordinates of age and length. The tagging data provide
  information about the observed length at release and length at recapture at a
  later time, where the age at release is unknown and estimated as a vector of
  parameters. The growth models provided by this package can be fitted to
  otoliths only, tagging data only, or a combination of the two. Growth
  variability can be modelled as constant or increasing with length.
